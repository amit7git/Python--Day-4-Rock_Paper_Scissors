# Day 4 – Rock Paper Scissors Game ✊📄✂️

Part of my **100 Days of Python Projects** challenge.  
This project recreates the classic Python Rock Paper Scissors game using a terminal-style web interface.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The Rock Paper Scissors Game allows the user to play against the computer.  
The player selects an option, the computer makes a random choice, and the winner is determined based on standard game rules.

---

## 📚 What I Learned
- Using lists to store multiple game options
- Implementing random choice logic for computer decisions
- Applying conditional logic to determine win, lose, or draw outcomes
- Translating Python game logic into JavaScript
- Managing interactive user input in a terminal-style UI

---

## 🛠 How It Works
1. User chooses **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**  
2. The computer randomly selects one of the options  
3. The app compares both choices  
4. The result (win, lose, or draw) is displayed  

---

## 💡 Code Highlights
- Storing game options in a list/array
- Randomly selecting the computer’s move
- Using conditional statements to evaluate game rules
- Displaying results dynamically in the terminal interface
